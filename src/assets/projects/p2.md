**Merge Sort Algorithm**

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works as follows:

1.  **Divide:** Recursively split the input array into two halves until you reach subarrays of size 1 (which are inherently sorted).
2.  **Conquer:** Sort each of the small subarrays (base case: arrays of size 1 are already sorted).
3.  **Combine:** Merge the sorted subarrays into larger sorted arrays until you have a single, sorted array.

**TypeScript Implementation**

```typescript
function mergeSort(arr: number[]): number[] {
  // Base case: if the array has 0 or 1 elements, it's already sorted
  if (arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr
  }

  // 1. Divide: Find the middle of the array
  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2)
  const leftHalf = arr.slice(0, mid)
  const rightHalf = arr.slice(mid)

  // 2. Conquer: Recursively sort the left and right halves
  const sortedLeft = mergeSort(leftHalf)
  const sortedRight = mergeSort(rightHalf)

  // 3. Combine: Merge the sorted halves
  return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight)
}

function merge(left: number[], right: number[]): number[] {
  const result: number[] = []
  let leftIndex = 0
  let rightIndex = 0

  // Compare elements from left and right arrays, merging in sorted order
  while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
    if (left[leftIndex] <= right[rightIndex]) {
      result.push(left[leftIndex])
      leftIndex++
    } else {
      result.push(right[rightIndex])
      rightIndex++
    }
  }

  // Add remaining elements from the left (if any)
  while (leftIndex < left.length) {
    result.push(left[leftIndex])
    leftIndex++
  }

  // Add remaining elements from the right (if any)
  while (rightIndex < right.length) {
    result.push(right[rightIndex])
    rightIndex++
  }
  return result
}

// Example usage:
const unsortedArray = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
const sortedArray = mergeSort(unsortedArray)
console.log('Unsorted Array:', unsortedArray) // Output: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
console.log('Sorted Array:', sortedArray) // Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`mergeSort(arr: number[]): number[]` Function:**

    - This is the main function that takes an array of numbers (`arr`) as input and returns a new sorted array of numbers.
    - **Base Case:** It checks if the array has 0 or 1 element. If so, it's already sorted, and the function returns the array itself.
    - **Divide:** It calculates the middle index (`mid`) and creates two new arrays, `leftHalf` and `rightHalf`, containing the elements from the original array split at the middle.
    - **Conquer:** It recursively calls `mergeSort` on the `leftHalf` and `rightHalf` to sort them independently.
    - **Combine:** It calls the `merge` function to combine the sorted `sortedLeft` and `sortedRight` arrays into a single, fully sorted array, which is then returned.

2.  **`merge(left: number[], right: number[]): number[]` Function:**
    - This function takes two _already sorted_ arrays `left` and `right` as input.
    - It creates an empty `result` array to store the merged sorted elements.
    - It initializes index variables `leftIndex` and `rightIndex` to 0, which will track the current elements being compared.
    - **Merging Loop:** It iterates through the elements of both `left` and `right`, using a `while` loop. In each iteration it does the following:
      - It compares the current elements at `left[leftIndex]` and `right[rightIndex]`.
      - It pushes the smaller element to the `result` array and increments the corresponding index.
    - **Add Remaining Elements:** After the main loop finishes, if there are remaining elements in either the `left` array or the `right` array, it iterates through the remaining elements pushing them to the `result` array.
    - **Return Sorted Array:** Finally, the function returns the `result` array, which is a sorted combination of the input `left` and `right` arrays.

**Key Points**

- **Time Complexity:** Merge Sort has a consistent time complexity of O(n log n) in the best, average, and worst cases. This makes it a very efficient sorting algorithm.
- **Space Complexity:** It has a space complexity of O(n), due to the need to create new arrays during the merging process.
- **Stable Sort:** Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the original array.
- **Recursion:** This implementation uses recursion to divide the array.
- **Types:** The code uses TypeScript types (`number[]`) to ensure type safety.

**When to Use Merge Sort**

- You need a guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity.
- Stability is important.
- You have sufficient memory available (because of its O(n) space complexity).
