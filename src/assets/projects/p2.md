### Good

- **Security**: The project avoids using dangerouslySetInnerHTML, which helps prevent XSS attacks.

- **Modularity**: The use of plugins allows for a highly customizable and extensible architecture. Users can pick and choose from a variety of plugins to suit their needs, making the library flexible and adaptable.

- **Unified Ecosystem**: By leveraging unified, remark, and rehype, the project benefits from a well-maintained and robust ecosystem for parsing and transforming Markdown to HTML.

### Bad

> _I would like to clarify that the following content reflects my personal perspective._

- **JavaScript**: The project still avoids adapting to a statically-typed language. Is written in JavaScript rather than TypeScript. Although they are using JSDoc to enhance the development experience, here is a brief comparison:

**_JSDoc vs TypeScript_**
Both TypeScript and JSDoc aim to improve the development experience and enhance JavaScript codebases.

However, TypeScript offers stronger type safety, better support for IDEs and build systems, and more robust code maintainability compared to JSDoc annotations.

By migrating to TypeScript, developers can leverage advanced type-checking, comprehensive autocompletion, and improved refactoring capabilities, leading to a more efficient and reliable development process.

While TypeScript can slightly impact build times, it has no effect on runtime performance. Additionally, TypeScript is better at catching type-related errors before runtime.

In conclusion, while TypeScript may require more time to adopt, it provides significant long-term benefits. JSDoc is a good alternative for existing JavaScript projects that need to go to production quickly.

_Propuse:_

> This propuse is for `react-markdown` library but my opinion is for all the librares in `remarkjs`
