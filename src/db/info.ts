    'My solution for this challenge consists of two projects.',

    'The second project is more like a brief commentary on why I believe Node.js projects should migrate from JavaScript to TypeScript, even if they are currently using JSDoc for type annotations.',
    'Additionally, I will use this web application to present the challenge. The code is available for review if needed.'

    '1. Identify an open source web application.',
    '2. Analyze the application to find well-written and poorly written areas.',
    '3. Document the reasons why certain areas are good or not good.',
    '4. Select one poorly written area and refactor or rewrite it.',
    '5. Document the changes made and the reasons behind them.',
    '6. Prepare a presentation to showcase the application, highlighting well-written areas, poorly written areas, and the refactored code.'
